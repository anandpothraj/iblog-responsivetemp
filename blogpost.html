            Find out which posts are a hit with Blogger’s built-in analytics.
            You’ll see where your audience is coming from and what they’re
            interested in. You can even connect your blog directly to Google
            Analytics for a more detailed look.A blog (a truncation of "weblog")
            [1] is a discussion or informational website published on the World
            Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text
            entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chrono
            logical order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the
            top of the web page.Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a
            single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small
            group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s,
            "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged,featuring the writing of multiple
            authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other
            media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar
            institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise
            of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and
            single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb,
            meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.I talk about philosophy, music,
